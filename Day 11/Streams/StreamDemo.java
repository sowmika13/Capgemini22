package Streams;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

/* 
 * 
 * Java provides a new additional package in Java 8 called java.util.stream. 
 * This package consists of classes, interfaces and enum to allows functional-style operations on the elements.
 *  You can use stream by importing java.util.stream package.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * stream provides following features:
Stream does not store elements. It simply conveys elements from
 a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
Stream is functional in nature. Operations performed on a 
stream does not modify it's source. For example, filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without
 the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection.
Stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.
The elements of a stream are only visited once during 
the life of a stream. Like an Iterator, a new stream must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.
